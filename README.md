# liquid noise

This installation visualises the impact of marine noise on wildlife using cymatics. Cymatics is a method to visualise waveforms in a physical medium, in this case through playing audio into small pools of water that form the basis of the installation. 

For example, whale song is clearly seen in pattern emerging from the water and the effect of noise distorting and visually masking the whale song is clearly seen. This technique was developed as part of the filming of A Voice Above Nature, a documentary exploring the effect of underwater noise pollution on marine life off the coast of Iceland, specifically humpback whales.

This code includes a whale and boat simulator written in Processing which sends MIDI data over to Ableton Live.
